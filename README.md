# Machine Learning Student Association workshops

The Python notebooks used in MLSA workshops.

This is the third time (August, 2019) that we are running the MLSA workshops, following the first 2 times successfully ran by [ecra93](https://github.com/ecra93/mlsa-workshops). 

Structure will be similar but we will explore more in depth of each topic and new dataset will be used. We will be adding more material over the next few months.
